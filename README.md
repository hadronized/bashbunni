### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

:panda_face: Currently working on some scripts and GUI desktop applications. Will continue to update my portfolio site as I go, but my priorities right now are building more software as I don't have much published software to showcase quite yet.

### A bit about me
I like skiing, hiking, doggos, organizing, and coding. 

I'm a huge fan of the open source app Super Productivity and I'm looking forward to contributing to that project in some way and working towards building my own productivity app(s). 

I also use Keybase for remote git repos; that's another great tool in my opinion. Beyond programming I'm also very interested in cyber security and writing programs to support infosec tools and reporting.
